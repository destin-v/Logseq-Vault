# Logseq AI Library

## Overview
This is a library of various Artificial Intelligence (AI) papers that I am in the process of adding to my Logseq app.

## Description
Logseq allows me to organize, search, and retrieve information in a way that is more intuitive than other software tools.  Information is organized into nodes which are connected to other nodes via links.  Searching is done via links which can be specific or general.  Nodes that are highly linked become *hubs* of information.


Here we show a graph visualization of how the nodes are linked.  When selecting a node, the user dives into that node which shows connections with other nodes.  Nodes can contain links to other nodes or assets (i.e. PDF documents) to information.
